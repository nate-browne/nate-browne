_translation: Text above says "I am a computer scientist and software engineer. I graduated from UC San Diego with a degree in computer science."_

My computer science interests lie in the boundary
between theory and practical computer science; my favorite domains to discuss
are algorithms, computer security, computer systems (especially operating systems),
programming languages, and computer networks.
