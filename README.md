# 你好, 我叫内特

我在旧金山是软件工程师。My computer science interests lie in the boundary
between theory and practical computer science; specifically, I like to discuss
algorithms, computer security, computer systems (especially operating systems),
programming languages, and computer networks. I enjoy reading research papers in
all of these domains (and more!).
